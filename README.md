# Seasonal-Time-series-prediction
This project is about a Time Series problem that involves prediction of number of commuters of JetRail, a new high speed rail service by Unicorn Investors. This is a data hackathon sponsored by Analytics Vidya. We are provided with 2 years of data(Aug 2012-Sept 2014) and using this data we have to forecast the number of commuters for next 7 months.
